A web app that allows users to choose the event and upload the picture and vote to win.

Due to the cost of the Google map api (to show the location of the map) and AWS S3 (to upload the image or the picture), I have purposely emitted the key and the password. On the event detail page, the page should show the city of the map and a place to upload the picture. The video is provided for the functionality of this project.
